US 10 Yr yield
The 10-year yield is used as a proxy for mortgage rates. It's also seen as a sign of investor sentiment about the economy. A rising yield indicates falling demand for Treasury bonds, which means investors prefer higher-risk, higher-reward investments.

fed action or outcome effect on 10 year yield-
Action includes buying the bonds they yield after 10 years and it may affect the economy. Federal Reserve also raises interest rates, which tends to be bad for equities. In general, inflation is usually negative for stocks.

Fed is a federal reserve which you can say is US Central Bank.
US 10 Yr yield above 1.60%. Not good for emerging markets equities.

securities in ban list
Market-Wide Position Limit or MWPL is a limit that defines the maximum number of unsettled option contracts for any given derivative stock. Currently, the MWPL for indian derivative stocks is 95%.

A security is under a ban period for F&O trading if its derivative contracts cross 95% of Market Wide Position Limits (MWPL). This means that the combined open interest of all F&O contracts for all the months taken together for that particular underlying crosses 95% of MWPL.

NSE Ban List section shows you Market-Wide Position Limit or MWPL for over 140 derivative NSE stocks. It also shows whether a stock is in Ban List or has chances of a possible entry in the near future.

If a stock has an MWPL above 80%, there are chances that it might enter the ban list in the near future

They provide resistance and support.
Pivot point= (high+low+close)/3
R1= (Pivot*2)-low
S1=(Pivot*2)-high
R2=pivot+(R1-S1)
S2=pivot-(R1-S1)
R3=high+(pivot-low)*2
S3=Low-(High-pivot)*2
You can follow this simple strategy here if day low breaks then short sell it.

Support and resistance (S&R) - Stock strategy
These  are specific price points on a chart expected to attract the maximum amount of either buying or selling.
you can also say them trend reversal levels.
support represents a low level a stock price reaches overtime, while resistance represents a high level a stock price reaches over time. 
Support is a price level where a downtrend can be expected to pause due to a concentration of demand or buying interest. 
if resistance cross you can make CE(call) positions if support cross then you can take PE(put) positions.
You can also say that these are Pivot points to take a trade.
It is suggested that don't take the positive position when Resistance is too high and support was too weak. 

Resistance is a price point at which the rise in the price of an asset is stopped by the emergence of a growing no. of sellers who wish to sell at that price. watch those stocks that have broken resistance levels and which move in the upward direction. such stocks are one of the favourite choices. The resistance price is a price at which one can demand more sellers than buyers.

The support price is a price at which one can assume more buyers than sellers. You Have to Buy Stocks on Support & Sell on Resistance.
To draw the support or resistance line on the chart select the free line or trend line. It needs two points same high, the same low and extends that line. It is like y =mx + c. start from these points.

if the support level is breached, the price of the stock continues to fall until it reaches a new support level. And if the resistance level is breached, the price of the stock continues to rise until it reaches a new resistance level.

Check resistance and supports of nifty, bank nifty and any stock. How this is helpful. learn how to form trading rules based on these lines.

Trend lines- Stock strategy
The trend line shows us sideways, uptrend, downtrend.
They tell us about reversals, breakouts, patterns (flags, pennants, channels) etc.

If there are two red lines below of trend line then it is a downtrend otherwise if there are two green sticks then it is an uptrend. In the sideways trend, we cannot draw a trend line.
At 45 degrees we cannot put a trend line.

unwinding
The term “unwinding” refers to the process of closing out a trading position in the stock market.  Unwind means offloading or selling a position.
Unwinding is used to refer to the closing trades that require multiple steps, trades, or time.  If an investor takes a long position in stocks while at the same time selling puts on the same issue, they will need to unwind those trades at some point. This entails covering the options and selling the underlying stock.

Long unwinding is a derivative term used for futures meaning decrease in open interest with falling prices. It means price are declining.

Selling the stock that is already bought is long unwinding. basically exiting long trades in the position.

Buying a stock that has been already sold is Short covering.
here stock move from support to resistance.

OI-Open Interest or open contracts or open commitment
High open interest for a given option contract implies a lot of people are interested in that option. However, high open interest doesn't surely mean the people trading that contract have the correct forecast on the stock. Open interest is not the same as volume. Future stocks are easier to predict due to OI data additionally.
open interest is used to identify potential trends and reversals in futures and options contracts. OI is a number that tells you how many futures (or Options) contracts are currently outstanding (open) in the market means total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as options or futures that have not been settled.
Open interest equals the total number of bought or sold contracts, not the total of both added together.
every future trader must follow the Open Interest in futures as well as options contracts 

To get the market range you have to find the highest OI of call and put options.
It also give you safe Strike price-
If there is more OI in 11400put and 11500 Call then 11450 is a safe Strike price to do trading.

You can also check its change of OI it also shows the highest number of active contracts.
with this, you can check if the stock price getting increase or decrease.
You must also track Highest oi change in CE or PE side?
Get OI range from this.
max min OI basically indiactes support and resistance 
To find out that oi is by sentiments or by hedging?
call oi- resistance
put oi- support
high call oi above current price means resistance
high put oi below current price means support

PRICE VS OPEN INTEREST - option strategy
PRICE 	  		OPEN INTEREST 	PRICE TREND

Increases 			Increases 	Long positions being built up, Price may go up

Decreases 			Increase 	Short position built up , Price may go down

Increases 			Decreases 	Short covering may start anytime

Decreases 			Decrease	Long unwinding, correction may occur 

An increase in open interest along with an increase in price mostly indicates long positions being built up.

PCR - Put call ratio: OI
It is calculated by dividing the total open interest of Puts by the total open interest of the Calls. The PCR is considered a contradictory indicator.

If the PCR is increasing during the correction in the up-trending market – this is a very bullish indication. An average put-call ratio of .7 for equities is considered a good basis for evaluating sentiment.

A rising put-call ratio, or a ratio greater than .7 or exceeding 1, means that equity traders are buying more puts than calls. It suggests that bearish sentiment is building in the market. And if it is less than 1, it means more calls have been traded.

if the ratio is less than 1 price will go up and if it is more than 1 then the price will go down. 
If the bar chart is higher then the market is bullish. If the put option is more then it shows support.
if the call bar chart is higher then the market is bearish. If the call option is more then it shows resistance.
https://www.indiainfoline.com/markets/derivatives/put-call-ratio


If the PCR is >1.25 = buy call 
If the PCR is < 0.75 = buy put

Also we have PCR Volume which is Put Volume / Call Volume

It shows the market's opinion of the stock's potential moves, but it doesn't forecast direction. If the implied volatility is high, the market thinks the stock has potential for large price swings in either direction, just as low IV implies the stock will not move as much by option expiration.

IVP in options
Two instruments for tracking historical volatility are the Implied Volatility Percentile (IVP) and the Implied Volatility Rank (IVR). 
Knowing the relationship between implied volatility (IV) and the current IV percentile might help you decide if an option is more affordable or costly.
A high IVP number, typically above 80, says that IV is high, and a low IVP, typically below 20, says that IV is low.
IV percentile is a useful indicator to quickly identify whether a particular stock’s IV is high or low. This, in turn, can tell us whether a debit or credit strategy is the prudent choice in the situation.
If current IV is high. As a result, options will become more expensive or “rich.”

delta- 
one of the major risk measure used by options traders. 
The value of the delta is one of the many outputs from the Black & Scholes option pricing formula. 
The output includes the option's delta value and other Greeks. 
The delta changes with changes in the value of the spot price.  
Delta helps us evaluate the premium value based on the directional move in the underlying. 
This is extremely useful information to have while trading options.

if a call option has a delta of 0.35 and the price increases by one Rupee, the option's price should increase by 35 paise.

Delta measures how much an option's price can be expected to move for every $1 change in the price of the underlying security or index. For example, a Delta of 0.40 means the option's price will theoretically move $0.40 for every $1 change in the price of the underlying stock or index.
Delta .4 means if underline stock up 100 points the option you bought will go 40 points up. Every 1 point change underlying the premium change by .4 points.

OTM options have a delta of close to 0. specifically 0 to .5
ATM options have a delta of 0.5 or around
ITM option has a delta between  .5 to 1 close to 1
The delta values usually fall within the range of 1 to -1. 

find Delta of any option strike
enter delta value, premium value enter current, market points up or down, calculate final value.more delta more profit

Delta neutral Strategies - option strategy
Delta neutral is a portfolio strategy that utilizes multiple positions with balancing positive and negative deltas so the overall delta of the assets totals zero. A delta-neutral portfolio evens out the response to market movements for a certain range to bring the net change of the position to zero.

All the hedge funds use Delta as a tool to build strategies.

As the put options have the inverse price relationship with the call, Deltas also have an inverse relationship, which means that put options have negative (minus) Delta. If you have a stock in your portfolio, it will effectively have a Delta value of 1. 

(0-1) CE and (-1 to 0) PE 

For instance, by using options alone, a trader can produce a delta neutral position in the following manner-

The trader can buy an ATM call option with a delta value 0.5 and an ATM put option with the value -0.5, to create a 0 or neutral delta value.
5 (call) - 0.5 (put) = 0 (neutral)
Similarly, traders can create a delta neutral position using options and stocks simultaneously in the following way,

The investor can buy 2 put options (100 contracts each) with the delta value -0.5, while owning 100 shares of the stock, to construct a neutral position.
(2 x 100 x -0.5) - 100 (shares) = 0 (neutral)

   

Volatility-
buy the call & put (ATM) option. apply this strategy near to the expiry. 
Volatility refers to the deviations in the price of an underlying asset. Traders can get profits out of volatility by constructing a delta neutral position.

It is because highly volatile stocks are expensive while less volatile ones are cheaper.  The following example can explain more about the use of volatility to make profits.

A company trading its stock at Rs.100. The money call and put options are trading at Rs.3 each.
Traders need to buy one call and put a contract (with 100 options each) at a strike price of Rs.100. The delta value of the call option would be 0.5 and that of the put option -0.5.
The overall delta value would be neutral and the total cost for the trader would be Rs.600.
The trader gets a profit when the stock becomes volatile. Profit can be made from calls if the stock price rises and from puts if the stock price goes down. Moreover, the trader can even make a fair amount of profit even if the stock exhibits a neutral trend.
This strategy is comparatively better than the effects of time decay.

Profit from hedging-  
Options are basically designed to hedge the portfolio. They can protect from unexpected movement in the price, which is against the portfolio. All the hedge funds use options as a tool to hedge the portfolio. Delta neutral strategies to hedge the portfolio are a popular method to use. For example, if you have a stock in your portfolio equal to the derivative lot size. Delta of your stock is one. You can hedge this by buying two lots of ATM puts or selling two lots of ATM calls. So, the options will also have one Delta. If the stock prices plummet, the options will give compensation for the loss. If the stock price moves upside, the options will have negative returns, which can compensate for the stock price movements.  

post x-
Time decay (theta) related to delta-
If we apply a short straddle, i.e. sell call and put of ATM, it will have a 0 Delta
Consider a company trading its stock at 100, with both at the money call and put options trading at 3 each.
The strike is 100 and the delta value of the call option is 0.5 and the delta value of the put option is -0.5.
The trader can sell a call and put contracts (with 100 options each) to create a delta neutral position with the credit of 600.
3 x 200(100 call and put options) = 600
as near as to the expiry, the probability is higher to get the profit.

Types of Breakouts-
Reversal Breakouts:
reversal breakout forms when downtrending prices sharply reverse and spike higher on heavy volume. This occurs from a combination of frantic short covering and bargain shoppers flooding into the stock.

Consolidation Breakouts: flat trading
https://chartink.com/screener/tight-consolidation-breakout-pivot

Triangle Breakouts:
These breakouts occur when the resistance level is flat but the support level steadily rises. This indicates that motivated buyers are becoming impatient and slowly increasing their bid prices causing the pullbacks to progressively become shallower. Eventually, there are no more pullbacks as buyers swarm in causing prices to breakout through resistance. This pattern is also identified as an ascending triangle breakout.

moving averages Indicator- Stock strategy
it is the price data over a specified period of time by creating a constantly updated average price. Moving Average is a trend indicator which is an average of closing prices in a time frame that can help identify a trading opportunity.
It is a trend following indicator easy to find the trend is volatile or not.
Volatile means it does not have any direction. Moving Average Indicators allow you to easily identify the “average” price of an asset over a specific period. A moving average is a number calculated from the total of closing prices over a defined period. MA Is based on past prices used as a lagging indicator. You can also identify support and resistance level indicators with this.
Basically, it is used to identify trends and confirm reversals. If the price is above the MA line then we consider its uptrend in the market. If the price is below the MA line then it is a downtrend. The breaking of the MA line implies the trend reversal.
200 days MA is The average stock price of the stock in the last 200 days.
There are various trends that you can analyse from it.
For intraday(short term trends) use- 10-20-period
For medium-term- 44-50-period
For long term- 200-period Moving Average
50 and 200 days MA is a popular strategy.

four types of MA-
With these types of moving average, you also have to decide the period. 
1- SMA (Simple)

2- EMA- exponential moving average- period

3- Weighted (WMA)

4- DMA

post x-
SMA
Simple moving averages focus solely on the mean price within a period.
For example, 10-day SMA sums up the past 10 prices.
A 50-day SMA or 52-week high/low Adds up the closing prices over the past 50 trading sessions, then divides that result by 50.

post x-
EMA
It stands for Exponentially weighted average. It is also known as the fast-moving Average. It validates that recent data is more appropriate.
Most useful and popular chart indicators.
Using the EMA, you can spot buy and sell signals and create a technical system for trading stocks.
It is a data point derived from historical closing prices.
EMA levels are good to fair levels to buy. EMA is very similar to SMA, wherein more weight is given to the recent stock price in the last 200 days.
The exponential moving average (EMA) gives a higher weighting to recent prices, while the simple moving average (SMA) assigns an equal weighting to all values. EMA can be used with various time frames. It is used in the fast-moving market. 
stock/index above 20 ema indicates positive sentiments (bullish)



post x-
Weighted (WMA)
Moving averages like the short term and long term moving averages are used in technical charts to determine the trend.
When short term moving average line cross long term moving averages upward, the trend becomes bullish and in the case of a downward cross, the trend becomes bearish.

Moving Average Crossover- Stock strategy
Crossover - single line (Buy the stock above the line - BELOW - sell)
crossover occurs when a faster-moving average (i.e., a shorter period moving average) crosses a slower moving average (i.e. a longer period moving average) means when the shorter period moving average line crosses a longer period moving average line.
One set at 20 periods -  This is your fast moving average
One set at 60 periods - This is your slow moving average
One set at 100 periods - This is your trend indicator
You know the trend is on if the price bar stays above or below the 100-period line.
This is one of the moving averages strategies that generates a buy signal when the fast moving average crosses up and over the slow moving average. A sell signal is generated simply when the fast moving average crosses below the slow moving average.
So, You'll open a position when the moving average line crosses in one direction and you'll close the position when it crosses back the opposite way.

closing above 100 Moving Average indicates indices can be bullish.
candle close above 20EMA indicates stock is bullish!

Volume indicator/Chart
volume of stocks in the share market, How much it is important if you do intraday trading. Volume is a great way to check the trend. You can check the volume of any stock. if the volume is high then it means it is more liquidity in the stock. It helps you to take the position or not in that particular stock.

If a stock regularly trades 2.5 million shares daily, but you notice it has traded 6 million shares by 10 am. Then there may be some chances of movement in the stock.

Liquidity-
Liquidity gives you to quickly enter and exit trades at an attractive and stable price. Liquidity is average daily volume/ market capitalization. Volume is the total number of shares traded in a particular market at a given time. It is recommended to trade only in liquid stocks because these stocks have a huge volume. 
These stocks show great movement in a short period. The volume of stocks matters a lot But based on volume, we cannot predict that this deal will give profit or not.
Before buying any stock check there is volume available or not If the volume is available then buy it otherwise avoid it. Don't do trading in volatile stocks. Buy stocks that are high in volume.
Get the stocks of the day depending upon news it will also show a great movement. Observe stocks daily movement w.r.t its price action. A volume of 50000 and 75000 shares is significant if the trade is for 50 to 100 rs.
The more the number of buyers more will be liquidity. liquidity is not the same as the volume. the difference between the bid and ask price is less.
Every strategy needs liquidity, volatility and volumes.

Stochastics ( Period - 14 ) indicator base trading
A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. This establishes a range with values indexed between 0 and 100. A reading of 80+ points to a security being overbought. The stochastic indicator is a two-line indicator that can be applied to any chart. 
it uses support and resistance levels

It is used to see if close(current) prices diverge from the assumed standard. It was developed by George Lane in the 1950s and is characterized by its clear buy and Sell signalling. This indicator comes under the momentum indicator.
This indicator uses 14 periods which is used to compare where the security's prices close over a particular period.
It shows the 2 lines are similar to the MACD lines in the sense that one line is faster than the other.

post x-
Stochastics Analysis:
Generally, it is represented by red and blue lines If the stochastic red line crossed/above 80 means the market is in the overbought condition. If the stochastic blue line crosses/below 20 then it means that the market is in oversold condition.
This is a very good indicator to get the entry and exit points of stock. You can use this indicator in intraday trading also.

Readings above 70 are considered to be overbought zone any time selling pressure or profit booking may come. Don't buy this stock at this time & readings below 30 are considered to be an oversold zone any time a buyer can take control and stock may move upward. Buy that stock and wait stochastic to cross 70-80 levels to book profit.
Stochastic below 30 is your buying point and above 70 is your exit point.

The price-to-earnings ratio P/E or PE	
It is the ratio of the market price of company stock to its earnings per share (EPS)	. 
It is also known as earning capital. share price changes every day so does its P/E.		
A low P/E ratio may imply that a stock is undervalued and therefore should be bought. 
The P/E ratio must be less than 30 which is considered good. Well P/E varies from sector to sector and from business to business.	
	
P/E is a derived term from EPS.
The P/E ratio was too high to buy at the price you brought the stock. IT MUST BE LOW	
low P/E with high dividend rates. BEST stock to invest.					
Exit your equity holdings or Stock positions when Nifty P/E starts going over 24.		
It must be less than 25 or low compared to peer companies within the same industry
p/e= Share price / EPS
			
IT companies usually have a P/E of around 25.						
Steel companies commonly have a lower P/E of 6.						
			
If the Rs.100 stock has a P/E ratio of 6 and the Rs.10 stock has a P/E ratio of 8,		
The rs.100 stock is cheaper because the investor is only paying Rs.6 for every rupee of earnings, as opposed to Rs.8 of earning for the Rs.10 stock. 

Price to Earnings ratio tells us how much we are paying for 1 Rupee earning of the company. 

The lower compared to peers, the better value we are getting.

Fibonacci Retracement - Stock strategy
basically used to identify potential reversal levels.
It is a part of technical analysis for finding support and resistance points. It is used to find support and resistance. it shows golden levels.
draw this with last swing. 
Retracement levels can be found from downward to upward and vice versa It is another method for calculating zones of support and resistance by using horizontal lines. Using time-tested Fibonacci patterns, traders can get a more nuanced view of the market.
Levels can be identified by drawing a trendline from the low to high. It is a great tool that provides levels or positions. It needs lots of practice to draw the line.
 It also has a projection and extension tool where you can put some values.
To draw the line you need two points at some condition. By practice, you will understand which points give you good entry points. These points are generally high and low.
It can be drawn With 2 valid points. You can check the calculation of these number they will give result in the same pattern. These numbers are selected from the Fibonacci sequence.
As we know the Fibonacci series is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811.
23.6%, 38.2%, 50 %, 61.8%, 78.6%, 100% are the  golden ratios. 

Divide any number in the series by the previous number; the ratio is always approximately 1.618-
610/377 = 1.618
377/233 = 1.618
233/144 = 1.618
Divide with an immediate succeeding number-
89/144 = 0.618
144/233 = 0.618
377/610 = 0.618
13/21 = .618
34/55  = .618
89/144  = .618
55/89 = .618
Divide Number two places higher-
13/34 = 0.382
21/55 = 0.382
34/89 = 0.382
Divided number 3 place higher-
13/55 = 0.236
21/89 = 0.236
34/144 = 0.236
55/233 = 0.236
21/89 =  0.236

implementation-
1- find low and high  - connect trend line

If it crosses 61.8% then it shows a trend reversal. Take trade after the pullback. When it crosses 38.2% make your position here. Exit after 62.8%.

150-240 =  90 point moves make it 100%.
380-489 - Total Fibonacci up move = 109
At 61.8%, -> 421.9
61.8% of Fibonacci up move = 61.8% * 109 = 67.36
Retracement @ 61.8% = 489- 67.36 = 421.6

The trend is your friend do not go against the trend.
Wait for 15 minutes after the market opens at 9: 15 am to settle down the things because this is a risky time to enter the market. Big investors can change the game at any time. After 15 minutes you can find the trend.
The main things for the trade are entry exit and stop-loss point which indicates the correct signal. As per strategies find out these points and strictly follow them. Either you get profit or loss exit the position accordingly.
only entry points are in our hands and nothing So, Book profit in 2-3 minutes and exit the position, again and again, follow it.
Be patient to wait for the correct signal to buy or sell as per your strategy. If you face some losses maintain excel sheets for that what you did wrong.

Risk reward ratio 
Risk reward ratio maintain
The risk/reward ratio marks the prospective reward an investor can earn for every dollar they risk on an investment. Many investors use risk/reward ratios to compare the expected returns of an investment with the amount of risk they must undertake to earn these returns.
The risk/reward ratio, sometimes known as the "R/R ratio," compares the potential profit of a trade to its potential loss
A good risk to reward ratio is 1:2 which indicates the profit or reward is higher than the loss. 
if you have a risk-reward ratio of 1:3, it means you're risking $1 to potentially make $3.
Another example-
BUY BANKNIFTY 37900 CE   CMP: 73   SL: 43  TARGET: 103   RISK:REWARD = 1:1

stop loss-
It is an order set with a broker to buy or sell once the stock reaches a certain price. It controls an investor's loss on a security position. Placing a stop-loss order for 10% under the price at which you bought the stock will limit your loss to 10%.
This order is placed to limit the losses when you fear that the prices may move against your trade. For example, if you have bought a stock at Rs 200 and you want to limit the loss to 195, you can place an order in the system to sell the stock as soon as the stock comes to 195.

It is an order placed with a broker to buy or sell a specific stock once the stock reaches a certain price. Designed to limit an investor's loss on a security position. For example, setting a stop-loss order for 10% below the price at which you bought the stock will limit your loss to 10%.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence ) indicator-

It is a momentum/trend indicator that compares moving averages to an easy to read “buy line.” Once the moving average has moved above this line, you may want to consider opening a new position.
This is momentum as well as trend following indicator that indicates the relationship between two moving averages of a stock's price. Always use MACD to identify the trend. 

It consists of 2 EMAs and histogram. Its default values are 12,26,9 means crossover of 12 days & 26 days EMA. If 12 EMA crosses 26 EMA then it shows sell signal and vice vera. Here it calculates the average of 12 & 26 days close price.
Fast MA Period - 12; Slow MA Period - 26; Signal Period - 9 
It draws the fast & slow signal MACD line.
It is a lagging indicator.
This is the crossover of the short and long term moving averages.
50 and 200 MACD is better if you want to hold stock for a long time.
MACD- histogram -ve to +ve, consist of two lines black & signal(red) line. 3 pts			It is Lagging Indicators		

post x-
MACD strategy-
combine two indicators RSI and MACD Which give good entry/exit point according to the direction of the stock price movement.
Green/Blue is a signal line which shows a fast-moving average.
Red shows MACD line it shows the slow moving average.
When the MACD rises above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal and when the MACD falls below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal.
When the lines crossed, the histogram temporarily disappears.
In downtrend, the fast line deviates away from the slow line and the histogram gets bigger, which is a valid sign of a strong trend.
Watch and compare MACD with candlestick direction in 1st section, when cross over takes place in an upward direction in MACD, stock moves upward and in reverse stock moves downward.
Watch the buy volume and sell volume bar in MACD increases and decreases with stock movement in a bullish and bearish trend.
Buy signal-
Whenever Macd line (black) cross the Macd signal line to upwards.
Whenever histogram converts negative to positive.
Whenever Macd signal line crosses the zero line to upwards.
If the red line is below the black line then short-sell it.

Gap fill - Stock strategy
gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock (or another financial instrument) moves sharply up or down, with little or no trading in between. As a result, the asset's chart shows a gap in the normal price pattern. The enterprising trader can interpret and exploit these gaps for profit.
 A gap “getting filled” is when price action at a later time retraces to the closing price of the day preceding the gap.
Gap fill stocks are stocks that have to retrace to a previous candle that's opened higher or lower than the current price.

What is TDS?  why it is deducted  & How to calculate TDS?   

TDS is Tax Deducted at Source. It is a way of collecting income tax, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961. Its aim is to collect tax from where an individual's income is generated.  As we know there are various sources of income.

A person (deductor) who is liable to make payment of specified nature to any other person (deductee) shall deduct tax at source and remit the same into the account of the Central Government. The deductee from whose income tax has been deducted at source would be entitled to get a credit of the amount so deducted on the basis of Form 26AS for TDS certificate issued by the deductor.

The government uses TDS as a tool to collect tax in order to minimise tax evasion by taxing the income (partially or wholly) at the time it is generated rather than at a later date.

TDS is applicable to the various incomes such as salaries, interest received, the commission received, professional fees, rent, Consultation Fees.  The person who is making the payment is responsible for deducting the tax and depositing the same with the government. This person is known as a 'deductor'. On the other hand, the person who receives the payment after the tax deduction is called the 'deductee'. 



TDS is not applicable to all incomes and persons for all transactions.
TDS only applicable above a threshold level. when the value of the payment is above the specified threshold level.
For example, there will be no TDS on the total interest received on FD/FDs from a single bank if it is less than Rs 10,000 in a year from that bank.

post x-
How To avoid TDS-
If a person expects that his total income in a financial year will be below the exemption limit, he can ask the payer not to deduct TDS by submitting Form 15G/15H.
The deducted TDS can be claimed in the form of a tax refund after they file their ITR
TDS Limit hiked from 10000 to 40000 on post office saving and bank deposit in the 2019 budget.
TDS certificates are issued by the deductor (the person who is deducting tax) to the deductee (the person from whose payment the tax is deducted). There are mainly two types of TDS certificates issued by the deductor.
1.    Form 16: which is issued by the employer to the employee incorporating details of tax deducted by the employer throughout the year, and
2.    Form 16A: which is issued in all cases other than salary.

For example, Mr Gupta is working as a salaried employee at a company and tax is deducted from his salary @ 15%. The company shall provide Mr Gupta with a Form 16 describing particulars in detail regarding the amount of salary paid and tax deducted on the same.
However, had Mr Gupta been working as a professional and received professional fees from an organization that is subject to TDS, then he will be provided Form 16A for the same.

Form 26AS also contains details of any tax credits that you might be eligible for. These tax credits can be used to offset future tax liabilities or to receive a refund for excess tax paid. 

Sometimes there can be a mismatch between details in Form 26AS and the calculations provided by your employer in Form 16.

Stock Volatility 

The higher the volatility, the riskier the security. Basically, it represents the speed and amount of price changes. It is the degree of variation of a trading price series over time as measured by the standard deviation of logarithmic returns means you can calculate the change of price in any given timeframe.
A volatile market is when the stock market increases and falls more than one per cent over a sustained period. You can check this on nseindia site. Greater the volatility higher the profit or loss. These stocks are beta stocks that have high volatility.
Important factors in the market are stock, price, historical data, implied or Underlying volatility.  As we know Percent/annum is the most common unit of volatility in finance. Volatility is measured in percentage.

RSI (Relative Strength Index) technical indicator. 
It is an index that measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold, using a scale ranging from 1 to 100. It reduces the risk of trading by drawing one line Which indicates bought and sold region. Used to analyze stock movement.  
This is a momentum indicator that estimates the degree of current price changes which is used for determining if the stock is overvalued or undervalued. It measures the speed of change in price movement.
RSI default setting is 14 but uses with 8 you will get a better result.
Trading Approach-
value 70 or higher indicate overbought conditions/region and an increase in the possibility of price weakening. Sell when RSI moves from above to below the overbought line.
value 30 or lower indicate oversold market conditions and an increment in the possibility of rate strengthening. One should buy when RSI moves from below to above the oversold line means buy the stock only when RSI passes above 30 levels.
This is one of the best indicators to do intraday trading.
Other Scenario-
Take a fast look at the RSI and look at whether it is above or below 50.
If you are viewing at a possible UPTREND, then make sure the RSI is above 50.
If you are studying at a possible DOWNTREND, then make sure the RSI is below 50.
You can also change the column values-
Set parameters value 60 and 40.
Below 40 short sell it
If above 60 then buy it.
This is also another strategy to trade with this indicator.

SHORT CALL BUTTERFLY:
BUY 2 ATM CALL OPTIONS, SELL 1 ITM CALL OPTION AND SELL 1 OTM CALL OPTION.
A Short Call Butterfly is a strategy for volatile markets. It is the opposite of Long Call
Butterfly, which is a range bound strategy. The Short Call Butterfly can be constructed by
Selling one lower striking in-the-money Call, buying two at-the-money Calls and selling
another higher strike out-of-the-money Call, giving the investor a net credit (therefore it is
an income strategy). There should be equal distance between each strike. The resulting
position will be profitable in case there is a big move in the stock / index. The maximum risk
occurs if the stock / index is at the middle strike at expiration. The maximum profit occurs if
the stock finishes on either side of the upper and lower strike prices at expiration. However,
this strategy offers very small returns when compared to straddles, strangles with only
slightly less risk. 

post x-
LONG CALL BUTTERFLY:
SELL 2 ATM CALL OPTIONS, BUY 1 ITM CALL OPTION AND BUY 1 OTM CALL OPTION.
A Long Call Butterfly is to be adopted when the investor is expecting very little movement in
the stock price / index. The investor is looking to gain from low volatility at a low cost. The
strategy offers a good risk / reward ratio, together with low cost. A long butterfly is similar
to a Short Straddle except your losses are limited. The strategy can be done by selling 2
ATM Calls, buying 1 ITM Call, and buying 1 OTM Call options (there should be equidistance
between the strike prices). The result is positive incase the stock / index remains range
bound. The maximum reward in this strategy is however restricted and takes place when
the stock / index is at the middle strike at expiration. The maximum losses are also limited.

post x-
BULL PUT SPREAD
SELL PUT OPTION, BUY PUT OPTION
For those interested in earning income through option premiums with limited risk
A bull put spread can be profitable when the stock / index is either range bound or rising.
The concept is to protect the downside of a Put sold by buying a lower strike Put, which acts
as an insurance for the Put sold. The lower strike Put purchased is further OTM than the
higher strike Put sold ensuring that the investor receives a net credit, because the Put
purchased (further OTM) is cheaper than the Put sold. This strategy is equivalent to the Bull
Call Spread but is done to earn a net credit (premium) and collect an income.
If the stock / index rises, both Puts expire worthless and the investor can retain the
Premium. If the stock / index falls, then the investor’s breakeven is the higher strike less
the net credit received. Provided the stock remains above that level, the investor makes a
profit. Otherwise he could make a loss. The maximum loss is the difference in strikes less
the net credit received. This strategy should be adopted when the stock / index trend is
upward or range bound.

post x-
LONG STRANGLE
A Strangle is a slight modification to the Straddle to make it cheaper to execute. This
strategy involves the simultaneous buying of a slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) put and a
slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) call of the same underlying stock / index and expiration
date. Here again the investor is directional neutral but is looking for an increased volatility
in the stock / index and the prices moving significantly in either direction. Since OTM
options are purchased for both Calls and Puts it makes the cost of executing a Strangle
cheaper as compared to a Straddle, where generally ATM strikes are purchased. Since the
initial cost of a Strangle is cheaper than a Straddle, the returns could potentially be higher.
However, for a Strangle to make money, it would require greater movement on the upside
or downside for the stock / index than it would for a Straddle. As with a Straddle, the
strategy has a limited downside (i.e. the Call and the Put premium) and unlimited upside
potential.

post x-
LONG STRADDLE
Strategy involving unlimited rewards and limited risk.
A Straddle is a volatility strategy and is used when the stock price / index is expected to
show large movements. This strategy involves buying a call as well as put on the same
stock / index for the same maturity and strike price, to take advantage of a movement in
either direction, a soaring or plummeting value of the stock / index. If the price of the stock
/ index increases, the call is exercised while the put expires worthless and if the price of the
stock / index decreases, the put is exercised, the call expires worthless. Either way if the
stock / index shows volatility to cover the cost of the trade, profits are to be made. With
Straddles, the investor is direction neutral. All that he is looking out for is the stock / index
to break out exponentially in either direction.

post x-
SHORT STRADDLE
Strategy involving limited rewards but unlimited risks.
A Short Straddle is the opposite of Long Straddle. It is a strategy to be adopted when the
investor feels the market will not show much movement. He sells a Call and a Put on the
same stock / index for the same maturity and strike price. It creates a net income for the
investor. If the stock / index does not move much in either direction, the investor retains
the Premium as neither the Call nor the Put will be exercised. However, incase the stock /
index moves in either direction, up or down significantly, the investor’s losses can be
significant. So this is a risky strategy and should be carefully adopted and only when the
expected volatility in the market is limited. If the stock / index value stays close to the

COVERED PUT
Effective when one has a neutral or bearish stance on the market
This strategy is opposite to a Covered Call. A Covered Call is a neutral to bullish strategy,
whereas a Covered Put is a neutral to Bearish strategy. You do this strategy when you feel
the price of a stock / index is going to remain range bound or move down. Covered Put
writing involves a short in a stock / index along with a short Put on the options on the stock
/ index.The Put that is sold is generally an OTM Put.

PROTECTIVE CALL or SYNTHETIC LONG PUT
Risk management tool to guard against the rise in the price of a stock when one has taken short positions.
This is a strategy wherein an investor has gone short on a stock and buys a call to hedge.
This is an opposite of Synthetic Call. An investor shorts a stock and buys an
ATM or slightly OTM Call. The net effect of this is that the investor creates a pay-off like a
Long Put, but instead of having a net debit (paying premium) for a Long Put, he creates a
net credit (receives money on shorting the stock). In case the stock price falls the investor
gains in the downward fall in the price. However, incase there is an unexpected rise in the
price of the stock the loss is limited. The pay-off from the Long Call will increase thereby
compensating for the loss in value of the short stock position. This strategy hedges the
upside in the stock position while retaining downside profit potential.

LONG COMBO
SELL A PUT, BUY A CALL
A Long Combo is a Bullish strategy. If an investor is expecting the price of a stock to move
up he can do a Long Combo strategy. It involves selling an OTM (lower strike) Put and
buying an OTM (higher strike) Call. This strategy simulates the action of buying a stock (or
a futures) but at a fraction of the stock price.  As the stock price rises the strategy starts making profits.

Long Call Condor
BUY 1 ITM CALL OPTION (LOWER STRIKE), SELL 1 ITM CALL OPTION (LOWER MIDDLE), SELL 1 OTM CALL
OPTION (HIGHER MIDDLE), BUY 1 OTM CALL OPTION (HIGHER STRIKE)
It is very similar to a long butterfly strategy. The difference is that the two middle sold options have different strikes. The profitable area of the pay off profile is wider than that of the Long Butterfly.

The strategy is suitable in a range bound market.
The Long Call Condor involves buying 1 ITM Call (lower strike), selling 1 ITM Call ( lower middle), selling 1 OTM call (higher middle) and buying 1 OTM Call (higher strike). The long options at the outside strikes ensure that the risk is capped on both the sides.
The resulting position is profitable if the stock / index remains range bound and shows very little volatility. The maximum profits occur if the stock finishes between the middle strike prices at expiration. 

When to use: When an investor believes that the underlying market will trade in a range with low volatility until the options expire.

Break Even Point:
Upper Breakeven Point= Highest Strike—Net Debit
Lower Breakeven Point= Lowest Strike+Net Debit

S3700    9.80
B3800    6
Net debit =  41.25-26-9.8+6 = 11.45

buys 1 ITM Nifty Call Options with a strike price of Rs. 3400 at a premium  of Rs. 41.25, 
sells 1 ITM Nifty Call Option with a strike price of Rs. 3500 at a premium of Rs. 26, 
sells 1 OTM Nifty Call Option with a strike price of Rs. 3700 at a premium of Rs. 9.80 
buys 1 OTM Nifty Call Option with a strike price of Rs. 3800 at a premium of Rs. 6. 
The Net debit is Rs. 11.45 which is also maximum possible loss.

It is very similar to a short butterfly strategy. The difference  is that the
two middle bought options have different strikes.
It is implemented when the investor is expecting movement outside the range of the highest and lowest strike price of the underlying assets by selling 1 lower ITM call, buying 1 lower middle ITM call, buying 1 higher middle OTM call and selling 1 higher OTM calls of the same underlying security with the same expiry.

Strangles

post x-
short strangle-  
when view of the market is range bound.	
Short strangle constructed on Thursday with 400/450 points away on either side from current market price, on weekly Nifty, has a win probability of more than 70%.
this overlapped strategy balances the probability game perfectly.

A Short Strangle is a slight modification to the Short Straddle. It tries to improve the
profitability of the trade for the Seller of the options by widening the breakeven points so
that there is a much greater movement required in the underlying stock / index, for the Call
and Put option to be worth exercising. This strategy involves the simultaneous selling of a
slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) put and a slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) call of the same
underlying stock and expiration date. This typically means that since OTM call and put are
sold, the net credit received by the seller is less as compared to a Short Straddle, but the
break even points are also widened. The underlying stock has to move significantly for the
Call and the Put to be worth exercising. If the underlying stock does not show much of a
movement, the seller of the Strangle gets to keep the Premium.

Construct a short straddle with 400 points away from market price on either side. Hedge this by buying strikes at 450 points away from market price - hence it completes iron condor setup.
Create a straddle at maxpain point or at strike having highest sum OI of both CE and PE. Hedge this to make a butterfly, by buying immediate next/two level strike from straddle point. This makes Iron Butterfly setup.

Say Nifty is trading at 13250
Sell 12850 pe and 13650 ce.
Buy 12800 pe and 13700 pe.
This completes iron condor setup.
Say max pain is at 13200.
Sell 13200 pe and 13200 ce.
Buy 13150/13100 pe and 13250/13300 ce.

Covered call	
It is an options strategy in which the investor has a long position in an asset and writes call options to hedge the downside risk to some extent.
You own shares in a company which you feel may rise but not much in the near term (or at
best stay sideways). You would still like to earn an income from the shares. The covered call
is a strategy in which an investor Sells a Call option on a stock he owns (netting him a
premium). The Call Option which is sold in usually an OTM Call. The Call would not get
exercised unless the stock price increases above the strike price. Till then the investor in the
stock (Call seller) can retain the Premium with him. This becomes his income from the
stock. This strategy is usually adopted by a stock owner who is Neutral to moderately
Bullish about the stock.

averaging price 
How to Calculate the Average Price of Your Stock Positions. Averaging of the stock price. This strategy lowers the cost per share if the stock has dropped. You can calculate the price easily.

I would suggest that never invest all money at a time if you do intraday trading. Trade on some amount if you see the market is not in your favour then do averaging with the remaining amount. Divide it into multiple parts so that you can limit a big loss. So, this strategy is good when you buy shares in a falling market. Here I will give you an example from which you can understand the things.

Suppose you buy 10 shares at Rs 30 (for Rs 300). If the stock falls to Rs 25, you lose Rs 5 per share. At this stage, you have two options First is wait for the stock to jump back or invest Rs 300 more at Rs 25 and buy 12 additional shares. This will bring down your average holding cost to Rs 27.2 (Rs 600/ 22 shares).

In an uptrend, averaging decreases the cost of purchase of new units, while in a downtrend it decreases the loss as the average purchase price Falls. It will be very helpful in intraday trading.

stock price (rupees) - shares
30 - 10 = 300
If it decreases to 25 then invest 300 more @25
25 - 12 = 300
Total-
600- 22

Average price = 600/22 = 27.2

This is also called the rupee cost averaging.

Doji pattern - Stock strategy
The opening and closing price of candles are equal in this pattern at some level. The market will go in the opposite direction if this pattern forms. These candles are found at the bottom and top of trends. When the buyers and sellers fail to decide on the market, It gives rise to the Doji pattern. It is a trend reversal pattern. So, In a Doji pattern, the market traverses its options both up and down, but cannot commit both ways. 
A Doji must seem in a current trend at a trend line or a support/resistance line.
In this, the length of upper and lower shadow varies and the candlestick looks like a cross, inverted cross or plus sign, Gravestone, dragonfly etc.
the simple strategy to check this candle. when 4 green candles forms then buy that stock also checks the trend with this it must be in an uptrend.
4 green candle form buy it 4 red forms sell it?	
If 4 red candles forms then short sell it but check market direction and volume. Exit the position when it shows Doji candles.
Strategy use here - recognize pattern and then trade setup accordingly
In this bulls and bear are in balance.

Option Trading 
Options Trading strategy is all about data analysis. You can use option chain data that would help you in Finding the Trend of the Market. options trading strategy can give profit when there is an increase in implied volatility(IV). Higher implied volatility can increase both Call and put premium. 
It is suggested that it is good indicator if  IV is greater than 30 for options.

The option is derived from derivatives. It allows you to buy and sell stock in a different way. Options are also called contracts. It forms a chain that just predicts the short term sentiments, not for the long term. By continuously buying and selling in options and stocks you can get a better result.

To trade-in options, you have to understand some terms like 
CALL option, PUT option, ATM, ITM, OTM, Delta,Theta, lot size, strike price, OI , stock/share premium, Option Greeks
These things are important in learning option trading.

Option Greeks:
It varies as a function of 5 forces called the Option Greeks which are Delta (Δ), Gamma (Γ), Vega (v), Theta (θ) and Rho (ρ). They provide a way to measure the sensitivity of an options price. The value of the option as calculated by the Black & Scholes model. 
These greeks are used for Risk management.

post x-
Vega
Vega is an option greek that measures the impact of the change in the volatility of the underlying on the price of an option. Vega calculates the change in the price of an option for every 1% change in the volatility of the underlying.

Suppose SBI is trading at Rs 300 in May and a June Call is selling for Rs 20. Let's assume that the vega of the option is 0.30 and volatility of SBI is 29%. Now if the volatility increases by 1% to 30%, the price of the Option will be Rs 20 + 0.30= Rs 2.30.

In case the volatility had gone down by 3% to 26% instead, then the option price will be:  Rs 20- (3 x 0.30) = Rs 19.10

post x-
Gamma scalping
Gamma measures the change in Delta with the change in stock price. This number is important only if you are trading ten or more lots with delta hedging.
Gamma scalping can be done through buying call or put options and selling-buying underlying stock futures, or through a combination of call or put options.

Call put future parity:
Understanding put-call parity is important for trading options. Put-call parity defines the relationship between calls, puts and the underlying futures contract A condition of the pricing of put and call options and related futures or forward contracts that prevent riskless arbitrage between the different instruments.

this principle requires the same strike, same expiration 
It determines the relationship between the price of put and call options
The formula for put-call parity is c + k = f +p,
c = call price 
k = strike price 
f = futures price 
p = put price.

future price - call price + put price - strike = 0

technical Indicators 
uses in trading to analyse stocks. Indicators are basically used to enter and exit the trades. There are various indicators that we use to predict that stock is bearish or bullish. Selecting indicators according to strategy implies a lot.
With these indicators, you can check the oversold and overbought zone using the indicator. As we know for trading technical analysis is very important. It is a process of forecasting future prices by analysing the past movements of the price. It is a repetition of regular/similar patterns of any stock.
In this, you study the charts, patterns of stocks with indicators. The patterns can be detected by indicators under certain Time frame.
Based on the patterns, you can take a position in the market.
There are two kinds of indicators: leading and lagging.
A leading indicator/oscillator gives a symbol before the new trend or reversal occurs. It leads the price action. When you use this indicator, maybe you will experience a lot of fakeouts. some popular leading indicators are stochastic, RSI, oscillators etc.
A lagging/trend-following indicator gives a symbol after the trend has started. It only gives signals after the price change is forming a trend. It is also known as a momentum indicator. Basically, it trails the price action. some popular lagging indicators are parabolic SAR, Bollinger band, MA(Moving averages).

It is used to determine strong entry and exit points in the market. It consists of columns of X's and O's that represent filtered price.
Here x means uptick - rising price and o means downtick - falling prices. Its main focus is on price action. So a sequence of Xs and Os variables used to narrate P& F chart.
Each column X or an O cannot be placed together in the same column means these columns are alternate to each other. It ignores the time aspect. Highly useful to interpret in volatile shares.

What is Candlestick Charts		
This is also called Japanese candlestick chart. It is a style of financial chart used to represent price movements of a stock. Here chart is plotted using a candle. The candle is fighting between bull and bear. It has body and shadow. Candlestick patterns are one way to interpret the price trend of a particular asset.
If the stick is Green means the price goes up.
If the stick is Red means price goes down.
A one-month chart on 1-day timeframe shows the 20 trading days as 20 "candlesticks". Each candle has these points open, high, low, close of that particular period.

Heikin Ashi
It is similar to candlestick and it is better because it gives clear direction. On this chart, you can also see open, low, close, high on each candle. Basically, it eliminates a lot of noise and creates many smoother charts. This makes the Heiken Ashi charts a good indicator for the noisy and choppy markets. It prevents traders from many of the false reversal signals and trade setup.
Just a small suggestion Don't try to use a lot of charts, because sometimes they are contradicting each other if not minutely interpreted. Only the price and volume is enough.
You can use “Heikin Ashi” pattern and “Stochastic” to trade more perfectly.

What is stock Chart patterns-
Patterns are particular price formations on a chart that predict future price movements. It is important to be familiar with price movement. They also help in determining trend direction.
To analyse these patterns you must know about resistance and support levels. Support is a point at which an asset's price stops falling and jumps back up. Resistance is a spot where the price usually stops rising and falls back down. You can draw a support and resistance line on the chart if you do trading. These points change multiple times. It's a great signal if volume increases to the upwards & price breakdown of the support line.
When there are more buyers then the price will rise. If sellers are more than price will fall.
It is possible that you can get future prices based on past movements. This is a part of technical analysis.

Chart patterns are distributed into reversal and continuation patterns.
These patterns can be used in bearish/bullish/volatile markets. These patterns formed in all types of charts, except for point and figure charts. If you want to understand these Patterns then observe the stock for 7-days. Find the range of stock prices.

Bollinger band Technical Indictor
Bollinger Bands are bands that make it easier to identify the price channel an asset typically trades within. When prices move towards the edges of this channel, they will either breakout (requiring further analysis) or return to the expected norm. It is a lagging indicator.
It gives us the limit of price movement and trend reversal point. It shows the upper and lower band. When the market is quiet, the band's contract volatility is less and when the market is loud, the bands expand means volatility is more at that time. It is Used to read market strength.
2 tracks intersecting each other inside Bollinger bands are called moving average. The moving average(MA) crossover should not be overlooked(miss). When you add this indicator to chart then it will show 4 options: Fields(column), period, standard deviation, moving average type.
voltality less then expand less if voltality more expand more- lagging indicator- bollingar band- use this with RSI or moving average indicator- when any candle breaks llimit then buy/sell it	

Chart analysis-
If the candles start to cross the upper band, then the price will increase.
If the candles start to cross the lower band, then the price will decrease.
When line touches the upper band then it means the price will go down when the line touches lower band then it means its price will go up.

post x-
Here you can use these strategies with this Bollinger band indicator-
1- RSI & MA-
If we use RSI/MA along with this band than you can get a more accurate signal.
2- Bounce strategy
You can use Bollinger Bands to identify the 'Bounce Back Price' to get in. Buying a bounce is a strategy that focuses on buying given security once the price of the stock falls toward an important level of support. Traders who "buy a bounce" attempt to profit from a short-term correction or "bounce" off of the identified support.

technical analysis indicators 
Following are the indicators that are very helpful to find out the Trend With this you can also get signals to buy and sell the stock it helps you in trading- 
ADX(Average Directional Index) or DMS-
ATR(Average true range) Indicator-
ROC(rate of Change) Indicator- 
CCI (Commodity Channel Index) indicator- 
William
MFI (Money flow index) indicator-  It also shows the overbought and oversold zone.

 post 189-
 CCI
 Its range is -100 to 100. It shows a bullish signal if CCI value crosses over -100.  It is also a momentum-based oscillator which is used to help determine when an instrument is reaching a condition of being overbought or oversold. 
it is leading indicator.

 post 190-
 ATR
 It shows the volatility of stocks. We can choose stocks based on ATR value. With this, you can also set stop loss. Higher the ATR value higher the volatility. it is regularly used in forex exchanging.

 post 191-
 ROC
 It is a momentum oscillator, which estimates the rate change between the current price and the n period past price. It can be used to identify a general trend, oversold, overbought conditions as well as divergences. The ROC indicator can be used as a timing tool within a trend analysis. 
 It is  leading indicator.

 post 192-
 ADX
 It determines whether a stock is trending or not and how strong the trend is. It is mainly used to determine the strength of a trend. If you do selling/buying according to the way market goes it will decrease risk and increases profit potential. When you add this indicator on the chart you will get two columns +DI(shows upward movement) & -DI(shows negative movement). You will get a range of signal between 0-100.
If it shows below 20 then it signifies the low volatility and if it is Above 20 or 25 which shows the trend. If it forms crossover which also presents the trend.
ADX is nondirectional so it will quantify a trend's strength regardless of whether it is up or down.

+DM = Today's High - Yesterday's High (when price moves upward)
-DM = Yesterday's Low - Today's Low (when price moves downward)
You cannot have both +DM and -DM on the same day. If there is an outside day (where both calculations
are positive) then the larger of the two results is taken. An inside day (where both calculations are
negative) will always equal zero

charges and taxes on each order placed in the stock market	
Service/Brokerage charges-
charges are different for intraday and delivery trades.
1- Equity cash brokerage:

Delivery (buy today and sell later) based equity trading-
0.3% (sharekhan)
Delivery brokerage free in Zerodha.

Intraday trading-
It means same day buy and sell.
.03% (sharekhan)
0.01% (Zerodha)

https://upstox.com/calculator/brokerage-calculator/

Example-
Suppose you have done trading total amount is 30,000 after buy and sell the brokerage will be-
In intraday- (30000*.03%) = (30000*3)/10000= Rs.9 brokerage
In holding- 30000*.3% = (30000*3)/1000 =Rs. 90

Note: Traded value is the buy and sell total value of that day plus brokerage amount.

2- Equity F&O Brokerage
In options, you have to pay charges on both buy and sell of contract.
Suppose brokerage is 20 then on buy/sell you have to pay Rs40(Rs. 20 Buy and Rs. 20 Sell).
Rs 50 per trade (sharekhan)
Rs 20 per trade (Zerodha)
These charges vary from person to person. If you become a good customer of sharekhan then they will reduce the brokerage charges that will save you a good amount.
To find the information about the charges they will present on the receipt that you got from your broker after trading. Also on the slip, you will get ISIN(international securities Identification Number) with each trade.
It is a 12 digit code that helps in identifying securities such as stocks, equities, notes, bonds, debt, funds etc.

Tip: Don't give any approval to your broker to trade on behalf of you. Their purpose is not to make you rich but to make themselves rich. So they will use margin to expand the numbers of trading to increase their brokerage.Avoid this kind of thing.
If you are not able to manage your money then you can hand over your money to Mutual Fund Manager.

post x-
Derivatives market-
It includes trade in futures and options(F&O). In F&O loss is limited and profit is unlimited. In this, there is a contract which is valid till expiry. Most active segments by value are Equity derivatives.
If you are doing trading on the expiry day of options, try to trade with less quantity. There is huge change occurs the premium can go down to zero. So do trade how much loss you can bear. I will recommend on expiry day try to exit the position till 2:30 pm and the great movement will be shown after 1:00 pm. If you can take the risk then you can check the movement after 2:45 PM.
To work in futures you need at least an investment of 1 lakh rupees. If you have an open stock position in Futures, you can either sell it off or rollover at the time of expiry. A rollover means traders readiness to carry forward their futures positions to the next series.

Generally, what beginners do they Buy on rumour sell on news this may sometimes cause a big loss. Try to avoid these kinds of strategies. 
First, learn trading on a dummy account to become comfortable with the trading platform.
Always remember that the Stock rate increases through stairs and falls through the elevator so always be prepared for a quick exit. 
Never listen to the analysts which you are watching on the TV, you are a better analyst than them. Marketing is needed for bad products. Even big investors are seriously trapped in many companies.
The Important thing is Companies that grow without debt, building strong brand name & value alone are investor-friendly. Zero debt firm will fall lesser, than a company with debt.
There is some rumour that the stock market is under the control of big businesses those who are utilising the best brains including Doctors, Engineers to analyse the trend of the market well in advance. Retail traders have no control over the stock price. The price of the stock is decided by need and supply.
If you have done trading then it will take 2 days to settle your amounts.
There are some other kinds of trading on which you can earn much more but they are very risky. Dabba trading is the kind of trade which i am talking about in which trade happens on paper or excel. This trade does not happen in the exchange market. You can do one trade on multiple stocks at a time but it is not a legal way.
Remember one thing trading is riskier. Never trade on borrowed money. Work on your extra money.

why not buy Put Instead of selling the call.

Short call has higher probability of profit than buying put option. If the stock remain unchanged or even rises a bit (not a lot), short call still makes money.
When you buy a put option, your total liability is limited to the option premium paid. That is your maximum loss. However, when you sell a call option, the potential loss can be unlimited. Hence your margining will be exactly like how the margins are imposed on futures.
As we have already seen, you buy put option when you expect sharp downsides in the stock. Therefore, you bet by limiting your risk to the option premium and play for the downside in the stock. You sell call option when you expect that the upsides for the stock are limited. You are indifferent to whether the stock is stable or goes down as long as the stock does not go above the strike price.

An In-the-Money (ITM) option is one that has intrinsic value and time value. 

Post x-
Intrinsic value of an option: 
The option premium can be broken down into two components - intrinsic value and time value. The intrinsic value of a call is the amount the option is ITM, if it is ITM. If the call is OTM, its intrinsic value is zero.

Post x-
Time value of an option: 
The time value of an option is the difference between its premium and its intrinsic value. Both calls and puts have time value. An option that is OTM or ATM has only time value. Usually, the maximum time value exists when the option is ATM. The longer the time to expiration, the greater is an option's time value, all else equal.
At expiration, an option should have no time value.

naked option

A naked option, also known as an "uncovered" option, is created when the seller of an option contract does not own the underlying security needed to meet the potential obligation that results from selling—also known as "writing" or "shorting"—an option.
A naked option is when somebody sells a call or put that is unhedged. 
A naked option is an investing term that refers to an investor selling an option without holding a corresponding position in the option's underlying.
Short “naked” options are calls or puts that are sold that have nothing to limit their risk (shares of stock, long options).

Algo trading
just enter capital, auto trading happens,	
Algo/auto/high-frequency trading(HFT). 
Retail investors are not allowed to do this HFT. It is mostly used by big firms like investment banks, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms etc. In India, we do semi-auto trading. In this, we use some software That is offered by brokers or purchased from third-party providers. On these kinds of software, you can set trading bots that will automatically place trades in your trading account. This is only available for zerodha, upstox users.

What to do for Algo trading:
You can apply directly or with the help of the broker for approval. Its approval is a multistep process. For this, you have to participate with relevant Algo trading strategy in the mock environment.

What we need for Algo trading:
Real-time data feed (costs - Rs.1500 per month)
Amibroker charting platform (Rs.20,000,)
A bridge/plugin that can connect the charting tool and broker account (Rs.40000 per year)
Order Management system that executes the trade/order. The best price which allows the broker to get his order filled is the optimal execution price.
A cloud server. (Rs. 20000 per year.)

Basic Flow:
1-Design strategy (when to enter, exit)
2 -Backtest it-
We use backtesting platforms in an attempt to improve training models and strategies(Algo). Here we use historical data.
For backtesting, you can use a platform like kuants, arque algo trader.
A web platform like quantra blueshift has given access to market data,& provide a platform To evaluate and build Algo strategies using the power of stats and computing.
3-Deploy the strategy to servers

Types of Algo trading strategies:
1-momentum/trend following-
In this, we are using different technical or quantitative indicators to analyze the available information. 

2-statistical arbitrage-
In this, we look at a ratio/spread between the pair of stock's prices.
If the spread goes beyond the expected range then you buy the stock
and sell the stock which has outperformed in the expectation that the spread will go back to its normal level.
arbitrage is risk-free profit.

3-ML based Algos-
In this, we use historical data of markets and feed this to ML Algo that they designed. Data is divided into testing and training data. The Algo learns the patterns and features from training data itself to a decision like identifying, classifying or practising new data or outcomes.
So, you need ML(Machine Learning) for trading and learn to Train and Test the dataset. There are different ML algorithms implemented on Financial markets data and you have to learn which algorithm is suitable for the ticker(It is price movement either it is up or down) according to current market conditions and at what time of day that matters.

4- mean reversion
learn the classic techniques from Mean Reversion Strategy in Python	

5-market making

6-sentiment basis

Prediction model:
1) Movement in overseas markets account for possible market sentiment or latest economic news
2) Globally, markets and exchanges are inter-connected influencing each other.
3) It is possible to predict the market trend in one geography by studying market movements in other geographies.

What should be the salary breakup for an 18 LPA CTC to pay zero tax?
80C: 1.5 Lakh Exemption. On top of it, government gives exemption of 0.5L(standard) every year and there is no tax for the first 2.5L of income. Net Taxable salary: Rs 13,50,000  (2.5+ .5 + 1.5)
NPS (80CCD(2)): Can save another 0.5L. Net Taxable Salary: Rs 13,00,000
Rent: Typically your HRA component is 50% of your Basic for a metropolitan where your Basic is 50% of your fixed salary. So, HRA is around 4.5L (37,500 paid in rent). Claimable exemption= rent paid-10% of basic = Rs 4.5–0.9= 3.6L. Net Taxable Salary= Rs 9,40,000
Home Loan: Suppose you have a home loan with over 2L interest paid. You can take that off as well. Net Taxable Income: 7.40,000
Health Insurance Premium (80D): Rs 25,000. Net Taxable Income: Rs 7,15,000
Savings Bank Interest (80TTA/TTB): Rs 10,000. Net Taxable Income: 7,05,000 (It's actually 9.55 L but the first slab as mentioned in pt. 1, is for 0% tax upto 2.5 L)

NPS(National Pension Scheme)
It is a retirement-focused, long-term investment option open to all Indian citizens between the age of 18 and 70 years. The basic idea behind this scheme is simple but very powerful. Invest while you are earning and get regular income in the form of an annuity when you retire. Restriction on withdrawal before retirement provides a long time to allow the money to grow. There are many prudent restrictions about the avenues where money contributed by NPS subscribers can be invested by pension fund managers. This helps in generating a decent rate of return on the corpus at comparatively less risk and relatively lower cost.


It can be extended until retirement. You can make an investment here. But it has one concern like long locks in periods in which people are not interested.

What is Tax planning?

Tax planning is the process of analyzing and managing your finances from an income tax perspective. More specifically, it is done to reduce the tax liability through a combination of investments and by claiming deductions and exemptions available under various provisions of the Income Tax Act.


In other words, tax planning is the optimal utilization of exemptions, benefits, and rebates with suitable investments.

The Income Tax Act offers deductions on certain investments and payments. These deductions are applied before computing your income tax liability. Some of the popular tax-saving instruments are:

 

Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)

 



 

 

Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)

 


 

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY)

 



 

Public Provident Fund (PPF)

 



 

National Pension System (NPS)

Individuals can contribute a minimum of ₹500 and a maximum of ₹1,50,000 in multiples of ₹50 in  an account in a financial year.

My age is 25 and I want to retire at 50. What is the investment plan for my retirement?

You are 25 now. You wish to retire at 50. You wish to build up a corpus. Let us frame a Strategy, involving, Debt, FDs, MFs, Equity.

Let me suggest 3 groups.


Group 1 Savings group :

SB, FD, RD, Variable RDs, KVP, RBI bonds, NSC, PO MIS.

ETFs(exchange-traded fund) like Bharath Bond, Bharath 22, CPSE. (kind of mutual funds)


Let us do some maths:


Let us expect 5% Annual yield.

₹1 , invested today, get a value of :

1.05^ 25 = 3.38635494, at the end of 25 years.


Let us allocate ₹10 today.

The value at the end of 25 years, is ₹33.86.


Group 2.Investment Group. Medium risk.

Equity Diversified, Small cap, Midcap, Blue chip funds, ELSS,NPS Tier 2 with 60/40,MIP 25. You may add similar funds.

Let us expect 10 % over 25 years.

Let us allocate ₹5 today.

The valueof ₹1 , at the end of 25 years,

1.10^25 = 10.83470594.

For ₹5, the value at the end of 25 years, is ₹54.17.


Group: 3,High risk, Equities and Equity Systematic Equity plan.

It reasonable to.expect 15% over 25 years.

Value of ₹1, over 25 years, 1.15^ 25= 32.91895262.

Let us allocate ₹5 today.

The value at the end of 25 years, ₹164.59.


Now let us find CAGR of the combination of the 3 groups.


Total investment today is ₹20.

Value at the end of 25 years, is, 54.17 + 32.92 + 164.59 = ₹251.68.

CAGR =((EV ÷ SV) ^(1/T) × 100 )- 100.

EV is end value and SV is start value.T is period

Hence CAGR is ,

((251.68÷20) ^(1÷25)× 100) -100=10.66


Now we have framed a strategy.

If Rs.20 is invested as, ₹10 towards Group 1 , ₹5 in Group 2, ₹5 in Group 3, the expected CAGR is 10.66.

Over 25 years, CAGR may oscillate between 7% to 12%.

Hence we may start investing in the above ratio, every time, for 25 years, we have every reason to expect minimum 7 to 8%.

And during 25 years of investing, your intuition and knowledge will improve, and you will learn how to improve your CAGR.


Compound annual growth rate - CAGR

rate of return (RoR) that would be required for an investment to grow from its beginning balance

breakeven point - option strategy
In investing, the breakeven point is said to be achieved when the market price of an asset is the same as its original cost.
The break-even point of an index call option trade is the strike price plus the premium paid.
well generally used in  option trading

Imagine a hypothetical index called Index X, which currently has a level of 500. Assume an investor decides to purchase a call option on Index X with a strike price of 505. If this 505 call option is priced at $11, the entire contract costs $1,100—or $11 x a 100 multiplier.

It is important to note the underlying asset in this contract is not any individual stock or set of stocks, but rather the cash level of the index adjusted by the multiplier. In this example, it is $50,000, or 500 x $100. Instead of investing $50,000 in the stocks of the index, an investor can buy the option at $1,100 and utilize the remaining $48,900 elsewhere.

The risk associated with this trade is limited to $1,100. The break-even point of an index call option trade is the strike price plus the premium paid. In this example, that is 516, or 505 plus 11. At any level above 516, this particular trade becomes profitable.

If the index level is 530 at expiration, the owner of this call option would exercise it and receive $2,500 in cash from the other side of the trade, or (530 - 505) x $100. Less the initial premium paid, this trade results in a profit of $1,400.

strike - price - lot - total - breakeven       expiration prediction   
505       11	 100    1100    505+11 = 516    530

Bull Call Spread - option strategy	
BUY CALL OPTION, SELL CALL OPTION

A bull call spread is constructed by buying an in-the-money (ITM) call option, and selling
another out-of-the-money (OTM) call option. Often the call with the lower strike price will
be in-the-money while the Call with the higher strike price is out-of-the-money. Both calls
must have the same underlying security and expiration month.

The net effect of the strategy is to bring down the cost and breakeven on a Buy Call (Long
Call) Strategy. This strategy is exercised when investor is moderately bullish to bullish,
because the investor will make a profit only when the stock price / index rises. If the stock
price falls to the lower (bought) strike, the investor makes the maximum loss (cost of the
trade) and if the stock price rises to the higher (sold) strike, the investor makes the
maximum profit. 

one long call with a lower strike price. one short call with a higher strike price.	

post 186-
Bear call spread - option strategy
SELL ITM CALL, BUY OTM CALL
This involves purchasing an OTM call and simultaneously selling an ITM call. The OTM call will have a higher strike price compared to the ITM call. The call options purchased and sold must have the same underlying stock or index and expiry date. An investor who uses this strategy will get net credit as the ITM call will be costlier than the OTM call due to the presence of intrinsic value and time value. If the stock/index falls as anticipated, both calls will expire worthless and the investor can retain the net credit. The net credit is the maximum profit that this strategy can generate. If the stock/index rises, it will result in a loss. However, the loss will be restricted to the difference between the strike prices of the call options, minus the net credit. 
when the markets are expected to be bearish.
Example-
Suppose the XYZ Index is trading at 4,400 and the markets are expected to be moderately bearish in the near term. The call options on the index with strike prices of Rs 4,340 and Rs 4,650 are available for Rs 65 and Rs 28, respectively. The put options with strike prices of Rs 4,350 and Rs 4,600 are available at Rs 25 and Rs 70, respectively. The market lot is 50 contracts
The cost involved in the bear call spread is Rs 1,850, which is the difference between the amount received from selling the ITM call option (50x65=Rs 3,250) and the amount paid to purchase the OTM call option (50x28=Rs 1,400). The amount, Rs 1,850, constitutes net income for Tarun and also his maximum gain if the markets fall. However, if the markets rise, the loss will be limited to Rs 13,650, which is the difference between the strike prices of two call options (purchased and sold) and the net premium [(4,650-4,340-(65-28))x50]. The break-even point of the bear call is at the XYZ Index level of 4,377, which is the sum of the lower strike price call (Rs 4,340) and the net premium (Rs 37) [see Bear Call Spread Pay-off]

The cost in the bear put spread is Rs 2,250, which is the difference between the cost of the put option purchased (50x70=Rs 3,500) and the amount received from selling the put option (50x25=Rs 1,250). This amount is also the maximum loss in case the market moves against expectations. The profit potential is limited to Rs 10,250, which is the difference between the strike prices of put options and the net premium paid [(4,600-4,350-(70-25))x50]. The break-even point is reached at the index level of 4,555, which is the difference between the strike price of the put purchased (Rs 4,600) and the net premium paid (Rs 45) [see Bear Put Spread Pay-off.]

Bear put spread - option strategy
BUY PUT, SELL PUT
An options strategy for bearish investors who wish to maximise profits while minimising losses.
This involves buying an ITM put option and simultaneously selling an OTM put option with the same underlying stock/index and expiry date. The ITM put option will have a higher strike price compared to the OTM put option. The transaction will result in a net debit payment, which is also termed 'cost of trade'. The strategy results in maximum profit if the stock/index crashes below the strike price of the OTM put option. On the other hand, if the market rises, the loss will be restricted to the net debit payment
when the markets are expected to be bearish

Volume Spread Analysis (VSA) - Stock strategy
Volume spread analysis is a new way of looking at the market. It more like the candlestick analysis taking into consideration the volume. However not all the candle stick rules apply here. The basic premise behind the volume spread analysis is that the market is basically moved by the “Smart Money”.
Volume Spread Analysis seeks to establish the cause of price movements, and from the cause, predict the future direction of prices
 Volume Spread Analysis or VSA analyzes candles (or bars) and volume-per-candle to determine price direction by figuring out demand

bonus shares		
These are the additional shares that a company gives to its existing shareholders on the basis of shares owned by them. These are issued to the shareholders without any additional cost.
WHY COMPANIES ISSUE BONUS SHARES?
Bonus shares are issued by a company when it is not able to pay a dividend to its shareholders due to shortage of funds in spite of earning good profits for that quarter. In such a situation, the company issues bonus shares to its existing shareholders instead of paying dividend.

Weekly Expiry Strategies  - option strategy	
1- huge opportunity for option sellers, where they write options in huge quantity on expiry days and make enormous profits, after all stats are in their favor. selling the OTM calls

2- option strategy
<img src="../../assets/images/Nifty-Open-Interest-Chart.png" style="width:60%">
		
here 9400 is last when put open interest is greater than call open interest. So the expiry will be above 9400. And 9500 is first when to call open interest is greater than put open interest. So the expiry will be below 9500.

The Expiry Day Trading Game
Now, keep 9400CE and 9500PE of same month expiry in your terminal. The real game starts after 1:30 PM. If you get Nifty below 9400 simply buy a 9400CE. You will get it at 1-5 rupees. Nifty will 100% rise above 9400 and you can get 10/20/50 even 100 rupees of your call option.

Similarly in the expiry day nifty option strategy if you get Nifty above 9500, you know Nifty will not expire above 9500. So simply buy a 9500PE. You will again get it within 1-5 rupees. Nifty will 100% fall below 9500 and you will get big gains.

Max pain theory-	option strategy
We can also use Options Max Pain in predicting the expiry value

Now, what this Max Pain indicates. This indicates the level where if the market expires, the options buyers will have maximum pain. In other words, this indicates the expiration levels. 

Max pain is the price at which option buyers would loss the most money, and option writers (sellers) would profit the most.
The theory suggests that before expiration the underlying stock moves to a point where there is a maximum loss to option buyers.

Protective put Married Put	strategy- option strategy
"Married put" is the name given to an options trading strategy where an investor, holding a long position in a stock, purchases an at-the-money put option on the same stock to protect against depreciation in the stock's price.
A married put is an options trading strategy in which investors hold both a put contract for a stock and shares of the stock itself.

This strategy involves taking a long position in an asset and also buying a put option on the same asset. In this strategy, the only risk involved is that the strategy is limited to the amount of premium.

Collar's- option strategy							
A collar is an options strategy that limits both gains and losses. A collar position is created by holding an underlying stock, buying an out of the money put option, and selling an out of the money call option.

A Collar is similar to Covered Call but involves another leg – buying a Put to
insure against the fall in the price of the stock. It is a Covered Call with a limited risk. So a
Collar is buying a stock, insuring against the downside by buying a Put and then financing
(partly) the Put by selling a Call.
The put generally is ATM and the call is OTM having the same expiration month and must be
equal in number of shares. This is a low risk strategy since the Put prevents downside risk.
However, do not expect unlimited rewards since the Call prevents that. It is a strategy to be
adopted when the investor is conservatively bullish.

closing price calculation		
The last traded price (LTP) usually differs from the closing price of the day.
The closing price is calculated by dividing the total product by the total number of shares traded during the 30 minutes. 

At 3 PM, the two shares of stock A were traded at Rs. 10 a share. At 3:10 PM, two more shares were traded at Rs. 12. At 3:20 PM one share of stock A was trading at Rs. 11. At 3:30 PM the price went up to Rs. 20 a share and two shares were traded.

Now to calculate the closing price, first multiply the number of shares to the price at the particular time. So, at 3 PM the total product is Rs. 20 (two shares multiplied by Rs. 10), at 3:10 PM the total is Rs. 24, at 3:20 PM it is Rs. 11 and at 3:30 PM it is Rs. 40. Add these values to find out the total product traded in the last 30 minutes: Rs. 95.

So your closing price is Rs 13.57 (Rs. 95/7). You last trading price is, however, Rs 20, which is the price at which the stock was traded last.

Why is closing price important?
If you are a market watcher, the closing price is as essential for you as the opening price, which is the price at which the stock opens in the market.

The closing price of a stock is a reference point for you to understand how a share behaves. You can study the closing price of price over some time, such as a month or even a year. Doing so will help you determine how well the stock has done over time and make an informed investment decision.

Filters - Stock strategy	
We can use filters to our benefit. the circuit is a very popular filter used in the market. It defines the lower and upper limit of any stock. Beyond this range, stocks will not move.		
A filter rule is a trading strategy in which a technical analyst sets rules for when to buy and sell investments, based on percentage changes from prior prices. The filter rule is generally based on price momentum, or the belief that rising prices tend to continue to rise and falling prices tend to continue to fall.

x-Facts
The golden rule of 72

The rule of 72 investors is a very fundamental concept in the stock market and one of the popular stock market facts. This rule is used by investors to calculate the time required to double the investment. If the fixed rate of annual interest is known you can determine the time required for the investment to become double. Let us understand this share market fact with an example.

Let us consider an investor who has invested Rs 5,00,000 and the interest rate is 8%, using the rule of 72 the time required to double the investment will be 72/8=9 years, i.e. it would take 9 years to double your corpus. You can use this rule efficiently for the low rate of interest.

Titan has a debt of Rupees 67 Crores. They have cash in hand of Rupees 1094 Crores. They probably took debt to do a favour to bankers or to leverage on tax exemptions.		Cash to Market cap ratio is 7% (Highly cash-rich compared to other companies). More cash in hand is always better.
